# 🛢️ DB2
Project for the second module of Databases @ Sapienza.

# 🗃️ Database
The idea was to have a db capable of storing pilots and competitions for engine-free gliders such as paragliders. We created an ER and then developed a SQL Database.

# ⌨ Application
There's a small java program that's connected to the database and displays the result of the queries (mandatory for the project). It has some basic functionalities as registering a race director, a pilot or a championship.
